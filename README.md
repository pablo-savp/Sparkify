# Sparkify
Data Science project using a dataset from a Music App.
The main idea was to obtain different conclusions and value from processing the obtained data in order to answer different questions.
Both the process and the questions are all within the uploaded Python Notebook.
# What I Learned
-Learned to use the Databricks platform, as the notebook was developed there.
-PySpark
-Pandas and Numpy
